# GeoCDB
Experimental Code for Conversion and Profiling the Proposed Implementation of [GeoPackage](http://www.geopackage.org) in the [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/) [CDB Standard](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cdb)


## Warning:

This code will modify an existing CDB repository by adding GeoPackage files and
removing ShapeFiles. **This will permanently alter the CDB database**.

This software code is experimental and may not work as expected. Backup your CDB and 
_use at your own risk_.

Please contact kbentley@cognitics.net with any questions, comments, pull requests,
etc.

## Converter Procedure

* Software Installations
  * Download and install python 3.7 (I think the script was tested with 3.6, but 3.7 has worked good)
    * https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.2/python-3.7.2-amd64.exe
  * Download and unzip GDAL executable somewhere on disk (if you donâ€™t already have it)
    * http://download.gisinternals.com/sdk/downloads/release-1900-x64-gdal-2-4-0-mapserver-7-2-2.zip
  * Download and install the GDAL python package
    * http://download.gisinternals.com/sdk/downloads/release-1900-x64-gdal-2-4-0-mapserver-7-2-2/GDAL-2.4.0.win-amd64-py3.7.msi
  * Download and install the dbfread python library
    * https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/4c/94/51349e43503e30ed7b4ecfe68a8809cdb58f722c0feb79d18b1f1e36fe74/dbfread-2.0.7-py2.py3-none-any.whl
    * python -m pip install _pathToDownloadedFileAbove_
  * There is probably easier ways to install these python packages, but our work internet breaks the easier methods that auto download and install
* Running the converter
  * Add the GDAL bin directory in the path (first, in case other programs have older versions of GDAL)
    * set PATH=_gdalBinDir_;%PATH%
    * set GDAL_DATA=_gdalBinDir_\gdal-data
* Run the conversion
  * pathToConverters\Option1d.py _PathToInputCDB_ _PathToOutputCDB_
